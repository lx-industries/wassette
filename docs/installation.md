## Next Steps

Once Wassette is installed, you'll need to configure it with your AI agent:

1. **Configure with your AI agent**: Follow the [MCP clients setup guide](./mcp-clients.md) for instructions on integrating Wassette with:
   - Visual Studio Code
   - Cursor
   - Claude Code
   - Gemini CLI

2. **Install agent instructions** (Recommended): Add Wassette-specific instructions to your agent's documentation to ensure proper permission management:
   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/wassette/main/rules/agent.md >> AGENTS.md
   ```
   This adds important guidelines that help AI agents correctly use Wassette's permission tools instead of manually editing policy files.

3. **Load your first component**: Try loading a sample component to verify everything works:
   ```
   Please load the time component from oci://ghcr.io/yoshuawuyts/time:latest
   ```

4. **Explore examples**: Check out the [examples directory](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/tree/main/examples) for sample components in different languages.

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If you get a "command not found" error after installation:

- **Linux/macOS**: Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH. You may need to restart your terminal or run:
  ```bash
  export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
  ```

- **Windows**: Ensure the installation directory is in your system PATH. You may need to restart your terminal or log out and back in.

### Permission denied

If you encounter permission errors:

- **Linux/macOS**: Ensure the binary has execute permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod +x ~/.local/bin/wassette
  ```

- **Windows**: Run PowerShell as Administrator when installing with WinGet.
